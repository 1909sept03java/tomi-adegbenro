                        <p>We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted. When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts. Let your imagination just wonder around when you're doing these things. We need a shadow side and a highlight side.</p>

                        <p>We must be quiet, soft and gentle. Take your time. Speed will come later. Clouds are free. They just float around the sky all day and have fun. I'm gonna add just a tiny little amount of Prussian Blue. Have fun with it. I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself.</p>

                        <p>All you need is a dream in your heart, and an almighty knife. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. Let's get crazy.</p>
                    
                        <p>Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. La- da- da- da- dah. Just be happy. You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush. The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job. Trees grow however makes them happy. We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us.</p>
