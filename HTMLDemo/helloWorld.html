                    <p>The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it. Trees grow however makes them happy. I'm gonna add just a tiny little amount of Prussian Blue. Think about a cloud. Just float around and be there. We'll play with clouds today. It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky?</p>

                    <p> We'll put a happy little bush here. I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here. When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts. We touch the canvas, the canvas takes what it wants. All you have to do is let your imagination go wild. There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend.</p>
                    
                    <p>We'll paint one happy little tree right here. You need to have a very firm paint to do this. Clouds are free they come and go as they please. Here we're limited by the time we have. It's cold, but it's beautiful. There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush.
                    
                    <p>Play with the angles. Let your imagination just wonder around when you're doing these things. Just let these leaves jump off the brush Now let's put some happy little clouds in here.</p>

                    <p>We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. It's a good way of getting rid of all your anxieties and hostilities. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see. Poor old tree. We'll make some happy little bushes here.
                    
                    <p>We need dark in order to show light. The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow. You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here.</p>
                    
                    <p>We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas. Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world. It takes dark in order to show light.</p>
